# Introduction-to-R

Topics Covered
- The case for R
- The command line & variables
- Types of objects - numeric, int, character, data frames
    - indexing
- Functions- creating functions
- Loops & if/else blocks
- Break! (I think)
- Importing data
- Tidying data + introduction to the tidyverse packages
- Data visualisation

Why R?
- While spreadsheet environments like Excel are still quite powerful and useful for data work, the ability to programatically manipulate data brings with it some unique advantages.
- Scalable - Code that analyses a certain dataset is size-agnostic - the same code could theoretically be used to work with larger inputs that still have the same structure.
- Reproducible - A code-based analysis inherently creates workflow documentation, which can be useful to refer back on.
- Efficient - Code can easily be converted into an executable script, which helps automate tasks.

Why R specifically?
- it's designed specifically by statisticians to be a statistical programming environment
- its base functionality allows for publication-quality figures
- its functionality has been expanded with hundreds of useful packages
- it's entirely free and open source!

RStudio or Jupyter Notebook?

Either works, honestly - it's all a matter of preference.
Jupyter is arguably more conducive to documenting a research workflow with its inline outputs and Markdown functionality, but RStudio's interface makes it great for putting together scripts and debugging. RStudio also contains a host of useful point-and-click features for things like importing data and viewing data frame structures.
